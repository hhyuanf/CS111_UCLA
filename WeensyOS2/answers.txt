Response to Exercise 1:

The name of the scheduling algorithm is:
Round Rodin


(Exercise 2 is a coding exercise)


Response to Exercise 3:

Average turnaround time for scheduling_algorithm 0:
(320*4-3+320*4-2+320*4-1+320*4)/4 = 1278.5 ms
Average turnaround time for scheduling_algorithm 1:
(320*4+320*3+320*2+320)/4 = 800 ms

Average wait time for scheduling_algorithm 0:
(0+1+2+3)/4 = 1.5 ms
Average wait time for scheduling_algorithm 1:
(0+320+320*2+320*3)/4 = 480 ms

Exercise 4:

Did you complete Exercise 4A or Exercise 4B?
Both of them
4A: Need to change PRIORITY in schedos-kern.h and also USER_PRIORITY in corresponding process file for alternating bewteen two processes if the two processes have the same priority level
4B: 

Exercise 5:
It should be the fourth process. From the picture, we can see that after successfully executing 4 rounds, the fourth process got interrupted, and that's why it didn't print out 4 on the screen

(Exercise 6 is a coding exercise)


Anything else you'd like us to know:
Set SYN in schedos-kern.h to choose from unsynchronized(1) and synchronized methods(2 and 3) for compare-and-swap and atomic_print respectively.


Exercise 7:
I implemented lottery scheduling. Process assinged with one ticket each is chosen to run with random ticket selected by scheduler.

Exercise 8:
I implemented atomic_print.
